# CS_Examples

Various C# Computer Science algorithims, pretending the richness of C# is not there and back to basics

AIM: Simple by elegant 

### Adhoc work in progress examples using as very basic C# code for general algorithms 

Current examples

- Bubble Sort(s),  with performance improvement
- Binary Search Recursive
- BinarySearch (nonrecursive)
- Items Not In Both Lists : unquie records from first list
- BubbleSort2
- Intersection of two array lists: In Both Lists
- Array Distinct

        
Note:  This is general code scraps opposed to proper coding.
